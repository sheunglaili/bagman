# Optimisation

To maximise the throughput of the Bagman server, there are few things you will have to configure on your host system which your containers run on. 
1. [The maximum number of open file descriptor](#maximum-number-of-open-file-descriptor)
2. [The local port range which tcp listen on](#local-port-range)

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout> 
If you running your containers with [Rancher-Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) or [Podman](https://podman.io), 
you will have to update the above parameters inside the VM they provision on your system as well!

## Maximum number of open file descriptor

To increase the number of open file descriptor, run the following command: 

For Mac & Linux: 
```sh
ulimit -n 65535 
```

## Local port range 

To check what local port range you are having on your host machine: 

For Mac: 
```sh
sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.first net.inet.ip.portrange.last
# should respond with: 
# net.inet.ip.portrange.first: 49152
# net.inet.ip.portrange.last: 65535
```

For Linux: 
```sh
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range 
# should respond with: 
# net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range=49152 65535
# values might differ depends on your system
```

To expand the local port range, we recommend setting the from 1024-65535 in order to maximise the tcp port that can be use

For Mac: 
```sh
sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.first=1024 # to set first port in range to 1024
sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.last=65535 # to set last port in range to 65535
```

For Linux:
```sh
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65535" # to set port range to 1024-65535
```
