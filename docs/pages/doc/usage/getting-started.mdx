# Getting Started

After [starting bagman locally](../introduction/installation), install any of the client sdk we provided:
- [Javascript/Typescript Client](./client-js)
- Swift Client (Coming soon)
- Java Client (Coming soon)
- Dart Client (Coming soon)

<Tabs items={['Javascript/Typescript']}>
    <Tab> 
        ```sh
        npm install bagman
        ```
        ```typescript
        import { Bagman } from "bagman";

        // initialise client
        const bagman = new Bagman({ url: "<bagman-server-url>"});

        // subscribe to a channel
        const channel = await bagman.subscribe("<channel>");
        // listen to a event in a channel
        // await to make sure listen is sucessful
        await channel.listen("explosion", (data) => {
            // do something with the data
        });

        // emit some data to the channel
        // await to make sure emit is successful
        await channel.emit("greetings", {
            "hello": "world"
        });
        ```
